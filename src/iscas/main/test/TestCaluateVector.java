The advantage of this approach is that it works perfectly (insofar as the stem of a word can be defined perfectly); the disadvantages are the space required by the dictionary and the investment required to maintain the dictionary as new words appear. The second approach is to use a set of rules that extract stems from words. The advantages of this approach are that the code is typically small, and it can gracefully handle new words; the disadvantage is that it occasionally makes mistakes. But, since stemming is imperfectly defined, anyway, occasional mistakes are tolerable, and the rule-based approach is the one that is generally chosen.";
